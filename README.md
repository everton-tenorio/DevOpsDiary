DevOpsDiary is an open-source initiative focused on making DevOps learning practical and engaging. Our goal is to provide real-world projects that bridge the gap between theory and practice, catering to learners at all stages—whether you're just starting out or refining advanced skills. With a community-driven approach, we encourage collaboration, solution-sharing, and continuous improvement.


## How to Get Started

1. Choose a Project

    - Visit devopsdiary.site.
    - Browse the Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced sections.
    - Pick a project (e.g., "Git Basics" or "CI/CD with GitHub Actions") and click "View Project" for instructions.

2. Organize Your Work

    You’re free to structure your projects however you like! Here’s one suggestion:

    - Central Repository: Set up a repo (e.g., devopsdiary-projects) divided by levels:

    ```bash
    devopsdiary-projects/
    ├── beginner/
    │   ├── 01-git/
    │   ├── 02-docker/
    │   └── ...
    ├── intermediate/
    │   ├── 01-ci-cd/
    │   └── ...
    └── advanced/
        ├── 01-kubernetes/
        └── ...

    ```

    Each folder (e.g., beginner/01-git/) should include your code and a README.md explaining your solution.

3. Complete the Project

    - Follow the project instructions from the website.
    - Implement your solution in your chosen repository.
    - Update your project’s README.md with:
        - The project title.
        - A link to the DevOpsDiary project page (e.g., https://devopsdiary.site/beginner/01_git_basics).
        - A short description of your solution.


Example:

```markdown

Link: [DevOpsDiary Git Basics](https://devopsdiary.site/beginner/01_git_basics)

## Solution

- Created and merged branches using `git branch` and `git merge`.

4. Submit Your Solution
Share your work via GitHub Issues:
