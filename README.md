# #DevOpsDiary

**A hands-on path to becoming a senior DevOps engineer.**

No paywalls. No subscriptions. No bureaucracy. Just structured, practical tasks that build real skills.

---

## How it works

DevOpsDiary is organized into three levels. Each level is a sequence of tasks that build on each other - you cannot effectively do task 5 without having done tasks 1 through 4. That progression is intentional.

**Beginner** - Linux, networking, scripting, Git, cloud CLI, and your first infrastructure project. This level alone covers what most people consider junior DevOps skills.

**Intermediate** - Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines, GitOps, service mesh, security, and full observability. By the end you will operate a production-grade platform.

**Advanced** - Platform engineering, FinOps, performance at scale, multi-cloud architecture, incident management, and everything expected from a senior DevOps engineer.

## Getting started

1. Go to [devopsdiary.site](https://devopsdiary.site)
2. Start at **Beginner** - even if you have experience, the early tasks build the foundation the rest of the path depends on
3. Follow the tasks in order
4. Build, break, fix, and document your work

There is no required format for how you complete tasks. Use any environment: local VM, cloud free tier, or your current work setup. The goal is that you actually do the work and understand what you built.

## Sharing your work

If you want to share what you built:

- Post on X with **#DevOpsDiary**
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/everton-tenorio/DevOpsDiary/issues/new?template=project_submission.yml) with your repository link

Your solutions may be featured on the site. This is optional - the learning happens whether you share or not.
