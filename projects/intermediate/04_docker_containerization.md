title: Docker Containerization & Best Practices
description: Implement efficient containerization strategies and optimize Docker builds for intermediate DevOps projects
tags: [intermediate, docker, containerization, devops]

## Requirements

1. Write a Dockerfile with a multi-stage build  
2. Choose a minimal base image (e.g., alpine:3.17 or debian:slim) and justify the choice  
3. Add a non-root USER and set an appropriate WORKDIR  
4. Create a `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files  
5. Add a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction in the Dockerfile  
6. Tag the built image with version `v1.0.0` and push to a registry  

### **Stretch goals**
- Use build arguments (`ARG`) for environment configuration  
- Automate semantic version tagging via Git tags in CI  
- Measure image size before and after optimizations  

### Deliverables
- Dockerfile and `.dockerignore` in a GitHub repo  
- Tagged image (e.g., on Docker Hub) with version `v1.0.0`  
- Documentation explaining build choices and results

- [`.dockerignore` reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)

### Learning Objectives

- Understand multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Select appropriate base images (Alpine vs. Slim)
- Configure .dockerignore for optimal build context
- Implement non-root user execution in containers
- Define health checks and semantic version tagging

Upon completion, you will have optimized container images suitable for production workloads.
