Learning Objectives

    Collect metrics with Prometheus and visualize in Grafana

    Aggregate logs using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

    Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger or OpenTelemetry

    Define SLI/SLOs and configure AlertManager

    Plan backups, restores, and disaster recovery (DR) procedures


## Requirements

1. Deploy Prometheus and Grafana in your cluster; import a sample dashboard  
2. Set up AlertManager for basic alerting on CPU/memory thresholds  
3. Install an ELK or EFK stack and forward application logs  
4. Instrument services with tracing libraries and view in Jaeger  
5. Document backup and restore processes (e.g., Velero)  

### **Stretch goals**
- Define SLOs for key metrics and configure SLA breach alerts  
- Implement anomaly detection in Grafana or alerting rules  
- Test and validate a full DR scenario in a separate cluster  

### Deliverables
- Helm charts or manifests for Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, and Jaeger  
- AlertManager configuration and sample alerts  
- DR runbook describing backup/restore steps
