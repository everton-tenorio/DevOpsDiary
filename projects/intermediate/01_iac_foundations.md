## Learning Objectives
- Understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts and benefits
- Compare declarative vs. imperative approaches to infrastructure management
- Learn about state management in IaC tools
- Set up a development environment for infrastructure automation
- Implement version control best practices for infrastructure code

## Requirements

You are required to research and document IaC fundamentals, then prepare your environment for future IaC projects:

1. **IaC Research and Documentation**
   - Create a comprehensive markdown document (`iac-principles.md`) covering:
     - Definition and history of Infrastructure as Code
     - Benefits of IaC (consistency, versioning, automation, etc.)
     - Comparison of declarative vs. imperative approaches
     - State management concepts and challenges
     - Key IaC tools in the industry (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Pulumi)
     - IaC security considerations and best practices

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Install required tools:
     - Terraform (latest stable version)
     - AWS CLI or Azure CLI (based on your preferred cloud provider)
     - Git for version control
     - VSCode with relevant extensions (Terraform, YAML, etc.)
   - Configure cloud provider credentials securely
   - Verify installations with version checks
   - Document your setup process

3. **Version Control Structure**
   - Create a Git repository with the following structure:
     ```
     infrastructure/
     ├── terraform/
     │   ├── modules/
     │   ├── environments/
     │   │   ├── dev/
     │   │   └── prod/
     │   └── .gitignore
     ├── ansible/
     │   ├── playbooks/
     │   ├── inventory/
     │   └── roles/
     ├── docs/
     │   └── iac-principles.md
     └── README.md
     ```
   - Configure proper `.gitignore` files for IaC tools
   - Document the repository structure and its purpose
   - Add a comprehensive README.md with setup instructions

4. **IaC Security Planning**
   - Create a security checklist for IaC implementations
   - Document strategies for:
     - Secret management
     - Access control and least privilege
     - Infrastructure drift detection
     - Compliance validation
   - Research and document IaC security scanning tools

### **Stretch goals**
- Create a simple Terraform module that demonstrates IaC principles
- Implement a pre-commit hook for IaC code validation
- Set up a basic CI pipeline for IaC validation
- Research and document state management strategies for different environments

### Deliverables
- Complete `iac-principles.md` documentation
- Initialized Git repository with proper structure
- Environment setup documentation with validation screenshots
- IaC security checklist and best practices document

Once you have completed this project, you will understand the concepts and principles of Infrastructure as Code and have a properly configured environment for implementing IaC in practice - setting the foundation for all future infrastructure automation work.
