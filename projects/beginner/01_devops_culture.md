## Learning Objectives

- Understand core DevOps principles and philosophies
- Learn about the DevOps lifecycle and its stages
- Explore CI/CD pipeline architecture and components
- Gain familiarity with the DevOps tools ecosystem
- Recognize common anti-patterns and how to avoid them

## Requirements

You are required to create a comprehensive Markdown document `devops-culture.md` that explores the DevOps methodology:

1. **DevOps Foundation**
   - Definition of DevOps and its history
   - DevOps vs. traditional development and operations
   - The business case for DevOps adoption
   - Key metrics for measuring DevOps success (DORA metrics)
   - Evolution from Agile to DevOps

2. **Core DevOps Principles**
   - Collaboration and shared responsibility
   - Automation of repetitive processes
   - Continuous improvement and learning
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   - Observable systems and feedback loops

3. **The DevOps Lifecycle**
   - Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor
   - How each stage feeds back into the next
   - Who owns each stage in a DevOps team

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Architecture**
   - Continuous Integration vs. Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment
   - Pipeline stages and components
   - Deployment strategies: Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling
   - Pipeline security considerations

5. **DevOps Tools Ecosystem**
   - Source control: Git, GitHub, GitLab
   - CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI
   - Configuration management: Ansible, Chef, Puppet
   - Containerization: Docker, Podman
   - Orchestration: Kubernetes
   - IaC: Terraform, CloudFormation
   - Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

6. **Common Anti-Patterns**
   - Treating DevOps as a toolset - tool adoption alone doesn't solve delivery problems
   - Ignoring human and organizational factors - communication and ownership matter
   - Thinking DevOps is a role, not a practice - it breaks silos, not creates new ones
   - Skipping fundamentals for trends - copying architectures without understanding context

### Stretch Goals

- Include a case study of a successful DevOps adoption (Netflix, Etsy, or Amazon)
- Create a visual diagram representing the DevOps lifecycle
- Develop a DevOps maturity assessment framework
- Write a glossary of key DevOps terminology

### Deliverables

- `devops-culture.md` covering all required topics
- Bibliography of sources consulted
- Glossary of key terms

Once you complete this task you will understand what DevOps actually means beyond tools and job titles - and that foundation will make every following task in this path make more sense.
