## Requirements

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` bringing up at least three services (e.g., web, db, cache)  
2. Use environment files (`.env`) for service configuration  
3. Define volumes for persistent storage (e.g., database data)  
4. Set up networks to isolate frontend and backend services  
5. Add `depends_on`, `healthcheck`, and `restart` policies  
6. Test bringing up/down the stack with `docker-compose up/down`  

### **Stretch goals**
- Use Compose override files for staging vs. production  
- Implement `profiles` to enable optional services  
- Simulate a network partition and observe behavior  

### Deliverables
- `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, and any override files in repo  
- Documentation on service relationships and data persistence  
- A demo script to launch the stack  

### Links
- [Docker Compose Overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  
- [Compose File Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)  
- [Compose Networking](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/)

### Learning Objectives

- Define services and dependencies in docker-compose.yml
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Manage persistent data with volumes
- Isolate networks between services
- Use health checks and restart policies

Youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience orchestrating multi-container applications locally.
