Learning Objectives

    Deploy Istio or Linkerd into your cluster

    Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) between services

    Configure request routing, retries, and circuit breaking

    Collect mesh telemetry and visualize traffic flows

    Secure ingress and egress within the mesh


## Requirements

1. Install Istio or Linkerd control plane in your cluster  
2. Inject sidecars into your application Namespaces  
3. Enable mTLS for service-to-service encryption  
4. Define VirtualServices and DestinationRules for canary traffic  
5. Collect and view mesh telemetry (e.g., via Kiali or Grafana dashboards)  

### **Stretch goals**
- Implement advanced traffic shifting (A/B testing)  
- Simulate a service failure and observe circuit breaker behavior  
- Export mesh spans to an external tracing system  

### Deliverables
- Mesh installation manifests or Helm values  
- Routing rules and telemetry dashboards screenshots  
- A brief report on security and observability gains

This exercise will demonstrate the power of service meshes in production.
