Learning Objectives

    Define pipeline as code for automated workflows

    Configure ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps deployments

    Use Terraform or Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning

    Manage application manifests with Helm charts

    Implement approval workflows in your GitOps process


## Requirements

1. Store Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts in a Git repo  
2. Install and configure ArgoCD or Flux to watch the repo  
3. Provision cluster infrastructure with Terraform or Pulumi  
4. Deploy applications via the GitOps controller  
5. Configure automated sync and manual approval gates  

### **Stretch goals**
- Implement drift detection and automated reconciliation  
- Use Kustomize overlays for environment differentiation  
- Integrate secret management into GitOps flows  

### Deliverables
- Git repo with pipeline-as-code and manifests  
- ArgoCD/Flux installation and Application CRs  
- Terraform/Pulumi code for infrastructure provisioning
